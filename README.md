# GBLM_SMOOTH
GBLM-smoothing model for estimations of LTP and STP

This repository contains 5 folders: helper, core, demo, absResQ and convergence

## helper folder
'helper' folder includes functions for alpha function and basis function

## core folder
'core' folder includes functions for the core algorithm.

## demo folder
Code in 'demo' folder is to show some examples for estimations. 

## absResQ folder
Code and data in 'absResQ' folder is to analysis the relationship between absolute residuals for modification (ISI-dependent) function and Q for long-term effect estimations. 
 
## convergence folder
Code and data in 'convergence' folder is to show the convergence of the algorithm, by 1) switching estimations of long-term effect (adaptive smoothing) and short-term effect (basis spline regression) and 2) setting random start.
