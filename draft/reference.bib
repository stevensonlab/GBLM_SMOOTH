abstract = {Since the innovation of the ubiquitous Kalman filter more than five decades back it is well known that to obtain the best possible estimates the tuning of its statistics {\$}{\$}{\{}$\backslash$mathbf{\{}X{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}$\backslash$mathbf{\{}0{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}X0, {\$}{\$}{\{}$\backslash$mathbf{\{}P{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}$\backslash$mathbf{\{}0{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}P0, {\$}{\$}$\backslash$Theta {\$}{\$}$\Theta$, R and Q namely initial state and covariance, unknown parameters, and the measurement and state noise covariances is very crucial. The manual and other approaches have not matured to a routine approach applicable for any general problem. The present reference recursive recipe (RRR) utilizes the prior, posterior, and smoothed state estimates as well as their covariances to balance the state and measurement equations and thus form generalized cost functions. The filter covariance at the end of each pass is heuristically scaled up by the number of data points and further trimmed to provide the {\$}{\$}{\{}$\backslash$mathbf{\{}P{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}$\backslash$mathbf{\{}0{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}P0for subsequent passes. The importance of {\$}{\$}{\{}$\backslash$mathbf{\{}P{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}$\backslash$mathbf{\{}0{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}P0as the probability matching prior between the frequentist approach via optimization and the Bayesian approach of the Kalman filter is stressed. A simultaneous and proper choice for Q and R based on the filter sample statistics and other covariances leads to a stable filter operation after a few iterations. A typical simulation study of a spring, mass and damper system with a weak nonlinear spring constant by RRR shows it to be better than earlier techniques. Part-2 of the paper further consolidates the present approach based on an analysis of real flight test data.},

@article{Volgushev2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Volgushev et al. Accurately describing synaptic interactions between neurons and how interactions change over time are key challenges for systems neuroscience. Although intracellular electrophysiology is a powerful tool for studying synaptic integration and plasticity, it is limited by the small number of neurons that can be recorded simultaneously in vitro and by the technical difficulty of intracellular recording in vivo. One way around these difficulties may be to use large-scale extracellular recording of spike trains and apply statistical methods to model and infer functional connections between neurons. These techniques have the potential to reveal large-scale connectivity structure based on the spike timing alone. However, the interpretation of functional connectivity is often approximate, since only a small fraction of presynaptic inputs are typically observed. Here we use in vitro current injection in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons to validate methods for inferring functional connectivity in a setting where input to the neuron is controlled. In experiments with partially-defined input, we inject a single simulated input with known amplitude on a background of fluctuating noise. In a fully-defined input paradigm, we then control the synaptic weights and timing of many simulated presynaptic neurons. By analyzing the firing of neurons in response to these artificial inputs, we ask 1) How does functional connectivity inferred from spikes relate to simulated synaptic input? and 2) What are the limitations of connectivity inference? We find that individual current-based synaptic inputs are detectable over a broad range of amplitudes and conditions. Detectability depends on input amplitude and output firing rate, and excitatory inputs are detected more readily than inhibitory. Moreover, as we model increasing numbers of presynaptic inputs, we are able to estimate connection strengths more accurately and detect the presence of connections more quickly. These results illustrate the possibilities and outline the limits of  inferring synaptic input from spikes.},

abstract = {A key problem in computational neuroscience is to find simple, tractable models that are nevertheless flexible enough to capture the response properties of real neurons. Here we examine the capabilities of recurrent point process models known as Poisson generalized linear models (GLMs). These models are defined by a set of linear filters and a point nonlinearity and are conditionally Poisson spiking. They have desirable statistical properties for fitting and have been widely used to analyze spike trains from electrophysiological recordings. However, the dynamical repertoire of GLMs has not been systematically compared to that of real neurons. Here we show that GLMs can reproduce a comprehensive suite of canonical neural response behaviors, including tonic and phasic spiking, bursting, spike rate adaptation, type I and type II excitation, and two forms of bistability. GLMs can also capture stimulus-dependent changes in spike timing precision and reliability that mimic those observed in real neurons, and ca...},

abstract = {Multiple stimulation protocols have been found to be effective in changing synaptic efficacy by inducing long-term potentiation or depression. In many of those protocols, increases in postsynaptic calcium concentration have been shown to play a crucial role. However, it is still unclear whether and how the dynamics of the postsynaptic calcium alone determine the outcome of synaptic plasticity. Here, we propose a calcium-based model of a synapse in which potentiation and depression are activated above calcium thresholds. We show that this model gives rise to a large diversity of spike timing-dependent plasticity curves, most of which have been observed experimentally in different systems. It accounts quantitatively for plasticity outcomes evoked by protocols involving patterns with variable spike timing and firing rate in hippocampus and neocortex. Furthermore, it allows us to predict that differences in plasticity outcomes in different studies are due to differences in parameters defining the calcium dynamics. The model provides a mechanistic understanding of how various stimulation protocols provoke specific synaptic changes through the dynamics of calcium concentration and thresholds implementing in simplified fashion protein signaling cascades, leading to long-term potentiation and long-term depression. The combination of biophysical realism and analytical tractability makes it the ideal candidate to study plasticity at the synapse, neuron, and network levels.},

abstract = {We discuss the R package SQUAREM for accelerating iterative algorithms which exhibit slow, monotone convergence. These include the well-known expectation-maximization algorithm, majorize-minimize (MM), and other EM-like algorithms such as expectation conditional maximization, and generalized EM algorithms. We demonstrate the simplicity, generality, and power of SQUAREM through a wide array of applications of EM/MM problems, including binary Poisson mixture, factor analysis, interval censoring, genetics admixture, and logistic regression maximum likelihood estimation (an MM problem). We show that SQUAREM is easy to apply, and can accelerate any fixed-point, smooth, contraction mapping with linear convergence rate. The squared iterative scheme (SQUAREM) algorithm provides significant speed-up of EM-like algorithms. The margin of the advantage for SQUAREM is especially huge for high-dimensional problems or when the EM step is relatively time-consuming to evaluate. SQUAREM can be used off-the-shelf since there is no need for the user to tweak any control parameters to optimize performance. Given its remarkable ease of use, SQUAREM may be considered as a default accelerator for slowly converging EM-like algorithms. All the comparisons of CPU computing time in the paper are made on a quad-core 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 Mac computer.
